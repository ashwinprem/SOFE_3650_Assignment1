## Structure

This repository contains all submission files as per the requirements outlined in the assignment.

The main directory features both subdirectories and files.  The first subdirectory contains the Java source code, and is labeled 'Design Patterns'.  The second subdirectory includes a test file ('Main.java') that serves as a means of testing the Java implementation by providing output, and is labeled 'Test'. The third subdirectory includes all raw image files that depict the output of the Java implementation, and is labeled 'Output'.  The fourth subdirectory is titled 'UML', and contains both a PNG and JPEG image file depicting the completed UML diagram of the design pattern architecture.  The files contained in the main directory include this Markdown document (titled 'README.md') and the rubric provided for this assignment (titled 'Assign1-Design Patterns.pdf').

'Design Patterns' contains all necessary project files, including IDE-specific files (such as the '.idea' and 'out/production/Design Patterns' subdirectories, as well as the 'Design Patterns.iml' module configuration file) and source code (including all necessary '.class', '.java', and '.txt' files).
