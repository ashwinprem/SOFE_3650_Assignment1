## Structure

This repository contains all submission files as per the requirements outlined in the assignment.

The main directory features both subdirectories and files.  The first subdirectory contains the Java source code, and is labeled 'Design Patterns'.  The second subdirectory includes all raw image files that depict the output of the Java implementation, and is labeled 'Output'.  The third subdirectory is titled 'UML', and contains both a PNG and JPEG image file depicting the completed UML diagram of the design pattern architecture.  The files contained in the main directory include this Markdown document (titled 'README.md'), the rubric provided for this assignment (titled 'Assign1-Design Patterns.pdf'), and a '.gitignore' file to prevent unnecessary file commits.

'Design Patterns' contains all necessary project files, including all necessary '.java' and '.txt' source code files.  One of the subdirectories in this folder is labeled 'Test', and includes a test file ('Main.java') that serves as a means of analyzing the Java implementation by providing meaningful output.  This output is captured in this document (below), as well as in the 'Output' folder:
